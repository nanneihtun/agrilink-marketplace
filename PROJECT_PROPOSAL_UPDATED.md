# Digital Agriculture Marketplace Prototype for Myanmar

## Abstract
Smallholder farmers in Myanmar face major challenges with price transparency, reliance on intermediaries, and limited access to secure digital infrastructure. This project proposes the development of a comprehensive web-based agricultural marketplace that will enable verified sellers (farmers, traders, and regional resellers) to list products with real-time stock and pricing, while allowing buyers to compare offers and connect directly through an integrated communication system. Developed in collaboration with Infinity Success Co. Ltd., the initiative aims to demonstrate how digital platforms can improve market access, reduce inefficiencies, and build trust in agricultural trade through advanced verification systems, real-time messaging, and comprehensive admin management tools.

## Problem Statement
Myanmar's agricultural economy is heavily fragmented, with farmers and regional resellers relying on informal resellers, social media platforms, and manual negotiations. This results in inconsistent pricing, high markups, and information asymmetry across the value chain. Payment processes are often informal and risky due to weak banking infrastructure and low trust between transacting parties. Without a unified and transparent digital marketplace, fair and efficient trade opportunities remain inaccessible to most smallholder farmers. This project directly addresses that gap by designing a comprehensive system focused on visibility, transparency, trust, and secure communication.

## Stakeholder Goals
Infinity Success Co. Ltd., a Yangon-based technology company specializing in e-commerce and digital solutions, seeks to apply its expertise to Myanmar's agricultural sector. The stakeholder's goals include:
• Launching a comprehensive digital agricultural marketplace prototype with advanced verification and communication features
• Partnering with NGOs and INGOs working in agricultural development, rural inclusion, or food distribution
• Using the prototype to engage funders, partners, and potential users for future development
• Identifying inefficiencies in current agricultural trading practices to inform future system design and expansion
• Demonstrating scalable solutions for rural economic empowerment
